Introduction to CNN
Convolutional Neural Network is a Deep Learning algorithm specially designed for working with Images and videos. It takes images as inputs, extracts and learns the features of the image, and classifies them based on the learned features.

This algorithm is inspired by the working of a part of the human brain which is the Visual Cortex. The visual Cortex is a part of the human brain which is responsible for processing visual information from the outside world. It consists of various layers, with each layer serving a specific function by extracting information from the image or visual. Ultimately, all the information gathered from each layer combines to interpret or classify the image or visual.Components of CNN
The CNN model works in two steps: feature extraction and Classification

Feature extraction is a phase where various filters and layers apply to the images to extract information and features. Once this process is complete, the extracted data moves to the next phase, classification, where it is classified based on the target variable of the problem.

A typical CNN model looks like this:

Input layer
Convolution layer + Activation function
Pooling layer
Fully Connected Layer
